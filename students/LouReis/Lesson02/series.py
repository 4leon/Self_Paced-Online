# Note that the Fibonacci Series is naturally recursive â€“
# the value is defined by previous values:
# fib(n) = fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)

# This function calculates the nth value in the Fibonacci Series.
# This is a recursive funtion.

# The first numbers are 2 & 1 and is the difference from the Fibonacci Series.

# similar to the Fibonacci & Lucas Series.  Where x is the nth value in
# the series, y is the first number in the series, & z is the second number.
# The user defines the first 2 numbers in the series.  If the user enters
# 0 & 1 then the result is the Fibonacci Series, if the user enters 2 & 1
# then the result is the Lucas Series.
