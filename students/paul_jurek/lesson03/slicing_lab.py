"""# Instructions
## Goal
Get the basics of sequence slicing down.
## Tasks
* Write some functions that take a sequence as an argument, and return a copy
    of that sequence:
** with the first and last items exchanged.
** with every other item removed.
** with the first 4 and the last 4 items removed, and then every other item
    in between.
** with the elements reversed (just with slicing).
** with the middle third, then last third, then the first third in the new order.
NOTE: These should work with ANY sequence â€“ but you can use strings to test, if you like.
Your functions should look like:

    return a_new_sequence"""
